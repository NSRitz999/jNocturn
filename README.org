* jNocturn
** Overview
jNocturn is a Tree Walk interpreter built in Java based on the implementation of the "Crafting Interpreters" textbook by Robert Nystrom. This interpreter contains a few modifications in the textbook, both recommended by the end-of-chapter challenges, the author's recommendations, and own personal preference.
